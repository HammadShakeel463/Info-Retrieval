Data Collection: Gather a dataset of labeled tweets, including both sarcastic and non-sarcastic examples.

Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine the sentiment scores of words. This can involve using existing sentiment lexicons or training a sentiment analysis model on labeled data.

Concept Level Knowledge Expansion: Use common-sense knowledge or external resources to find sentiment scores for words that do not have known sentiment scores in the sentiment lexicon. This step aims to expand the sentiment knowledge base.

Coherence Analysis: Analyze the coherence of sentences within a tweet to ensure that tweets with contradictory sentiment scores have dependent relationships across multiple sentences. Develop rules or algorithms to identify and handle incoherent tweets.

Feature Extraction: Construct feature vectors for each tweet based on the sentiment scores of words, common-sense concept sentiment scores, and coherence information. This step involves combining and organizing the features into a suitable format for classification.

SVM Classification: Train an SVM classifier using the constructed feature vectors. Split the dataset into training and testing sets and tune the SVM hyperparameters as needed. Train separate SVM classifiers using N-gram features and the proposed features.

Ensemble Classification: Combine the predictions of the N-gram classifier and the proposed feature-based classifier. Develop an ensemble approach to make a more reliable judgment between the two classifiers and choose the final result. This can involve using voting, weighting, or other ensemble techniques.

Baseline Comparison: Compare the results of the proposed method against two strong baselines. One baseline is derived based on the definition of sarcasm, and the other is an SVM classifier trained with N-gram features. Evaluate the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or other relevant metrics to assess the performance of the proposed method.

Model Evaluation and Fine-tuning: Evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the testing set and analyze the results. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Fine-tune the model, adjust feature representations, or experiment with different approaches to enhance performance.

Deployment and Application: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment or integrate it into an application where it can be used for sarcasm detection in tweets. Ensure the model is robust and can handle real-world data effectively.

Continuous Improvement: Monitor the model's performance over time, collect user feedback, and gather additional labeled data if necessary. Continuously analyze and refine the approach to enhance accuracy, handle new challenges, and adapt to evolving language patterns.

It's important to note that the exact implementation details and algorithms may vary based on the specific techniques, tools, and resources you choose to use. Experimentation, iteration, and thorough evaluation are key to developing an effective sarcasm detection system.
